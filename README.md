# network-intrusion-detectio
**Overview**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to analyze network traffic data and classify potential intrusions to enhance cybersecurity measures.

**Features**

Preprocessing of network traffic data

Feature selection and engineering

Machine learning model training and evaluation

Detection of malicious network activities

Visualization of results

**Usage**

Open the network intrusion detection.ipynb notebook.

Follow the step-by-step instructions to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

Modify hyperparameters or try different models to improve accuracy.

**Dependencies**

Ensure the following libraries are installed:

Python (>=3.8)

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

**Dataset**

This project requires a network traffic dataset such as NSL-KDD or CIC-IDS2017. Ensure you download and preprocess the dataset before running the model.

**Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests for improvements or new features.
